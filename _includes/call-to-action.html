                  I’m very much a people person, lover of French Bulldogs, world traveller and I’ve always had a keen interest in the tech world. This love of tech started out from an early age at high school where we played around with Pascal and then moving onto my early career as a Desktop Support Engineer.

                  My real passion for coding came later, when I retired as a Money Broker and started my own online business.

                  I loved playing around with my website, making small changes to how it looked and even though I wasn’t a full-fledged coder I wanted to delve deeper and to forge my career as a Web Developer. So in 2015 I took the opportunity to further my knowledge and completed the General Assembly WDI bootcamp.
