description: For my final project I built a story making app using a MEAN Stack. With additional styling using SASS, CSS and JavaScript. A user can log in to the site, locally or using Facebook and fill in a form to create a new story. The user can paste the story and link images and the story will be created using a parallax affect for users to scroll through and enjoy.
